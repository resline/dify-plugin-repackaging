# File Upload Fix Summary

## Issue
The "Start Repackaging" button was reported as missing for file uploads in the Dify Plugin Repackaging web application.

## Investigation Findings
1. The button was actually present in the code (UploadForm.tsx, lines 262-289)
2. The button is conditionally rendered based on `selectedFile` state
3. There were duplicate .jsx and .tsx versions of components which could cause conflicts

## Root Cause
The issue was likely caused by:
1. Module resolution conflicts between .jsx and .tsx files
2. Potential state management issues between FileUpload and UploadForm components

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Duplicate Files
- Removed old .jsx versions of components that had been migrated to TypeScript
- This ensures consistent module resolution

### 2. Fixed Style JSX Issue
- Removed `<style jsx>` tag from FileUpload.tsx (not compatible with React TypeScript)
- The shake animation was already defined in index.css

### 3. Added Integration Test
- Created `UploadForm.FileUpload.integration.test.tsx` to verify the file upload flow
- Test confirms that the "Start Repackaging" button appears after file selection

## Verification
All tests are passing, confirming that:
1. File selection works correctly
2. The "Start Repackaging" button appears when a file is selected
3. The button triggers the appropriate callback with file data
4. The component maintains state correctly across re-renders

## File Upload Flow
1. User selects a .difypkg file via FileUpload component
2. File is validated (extension and size checks)
3. FileUpload calls `onFileSelect` callback with file data
4. UploadForm updates its `selectedFile` state
5. "Start Repackaging" button renders when `selectedFile` is not null
6. Clicking the button calls `onSubmitFile` with file, platform, and suffix data

The issue should now be resolved.
